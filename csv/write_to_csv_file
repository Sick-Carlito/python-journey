import csv  # Step 1: Import Python's built-in CSV module

# Step 2: Create a list of employees (each employee is a list of values)
employees = [
    ["id", "name", "role"],  # Header row
    [1, "Alice", "Developer"],
    [2, "Bob", "Designer"],
    [3, "Charlie", "Project Manager"]
]

# Step 3: Write the data to a CSV file
with open("employees.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)  # Create a writer object to write to the CSV
    writer.writerows(employees)  # Write multiple rows from the list
# Step 4: Read the data back from the CSV file
with open("employees.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)  # Create a reader object to read the file
    for row in reader:
        print(row)  # Print each row as a list

# Step 5: Read employees and format the output
with open("employees.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    next(reader)  # Skip the header row
    for row in reader:
        emp_id, name, role = row  # Unpack values
        print(f"Employee {name} (ID: {emp_id}) works as a {role}.")
